# Classify Countries using KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering based on Selected Attributes
This is an Individual Project, my work consists of:

* Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset with 200+ countriesâ€™ world indicators in Python, conduct data normalization and data scaling using sk-learn package
* Applied K-Means and Hierarchical clustering to group similar countries based on selected attributes, evaluated cluster quality using internal validation matrix
* Tabulate and analyze properties of countries in different clusters
